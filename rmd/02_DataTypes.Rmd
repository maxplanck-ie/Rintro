# From Vectors to Matrices

```{r}
v=1:20
str(v)    # str helps to understand the structure of an object

M=matrix(v, ncol=5)
M         # show the whole object.
str(M)    # more concise summary, especially for large objects
class(M)  # class helps to understand which functions maybe used
typeof(M) # matrix entries always have a single data type

```
# Added information for matrices
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dim(M)  
nrow(M)
ncol(M)
length(M)
```

# Matrices != Vectors
```{r}
is.vector(M)
is.vector(M[,1]) # matrix is a collection of vectors

is.vector(v)
dim(v)           # dim() is not defined for vectors
nrow(v)          # nrow() is not defined for vectors
dim(v)=c(4,5)    # another way to convert vector to matrix
v
is.vector(v)
class(v)
nrow(v)

dim(v)=c(2,10)  # dim can be redefined to change shape of matrix
```

**Task**: Try to understand what happens here:
```{r}
# try: dim(v)=c(3,7)
M=matrix(v,ncol=7) 
dim(v)=c(2,2,5)
class(v)
```

**Task**: Convert the first 9 square numbers into a 3x3 matrix:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
M=(1:9)^2
dim(M)=c(3,3)
M
```

***

# Combining and appending matrices
```{r}
M=matrix(v,nrow=4)
M
Mr=rbind(M,1:5)
Mr
Mc=cbind(M,1:4)
Mc
```

# Naming Matrices
What are the following commands doing? Inspect matrix $M$ before and after.
```{r}
rownames(M)=letters[1:nrow(M)]
colnames(M)=LETTERS[1:ncol(M)]
```

# Powerful Subsetting
R has a number of ways to access subsets of data very efficiently:
```{r}
M
M[1:2,c(2,4)]                  # subsetting by index
M[c("c","a"),c("D","A","E")]   # subsetting by name
M[,-3]                         # subsetting by exclusion
```
**Task**: Extract the submatrix of M where the second column has only even entries.  
**Tip**: Look at an example of the modulo operator first; example("%%")
```{r, echo=FALSE}
i=M[,2]%%2==0
M[i,]
```

# New functionalities for matrices
Execute and understand the following expressions
```{r, eval=F}
t(M)
v=as.vector(M)
summary(v)
summary(M)

det(M)
det(M[1:2,3:4])
```


# Matrix Magic
```{r}
S=outer(1:3, 4:6)  # what is this function doing?
S
diag(S)
upper.tri(S)       # what type/class of matrix is this ?
S[upper.tri(S)]=0  # subsetting by truth values. What will be the result?
```

***

# Data Frames
Data frames superseed matrices. They relax the requirement of having  the same data type for all entries.
This can be considered the R-equivalent of an EXCEL table. Data frames collect nrow *observations* for ncol *variables*
```{r}
D=data.frame(x=1:9,l=letters[1:9], b=1:9<5)
class(D)
str(D)   # structure of object D
head(D)  # a very useful first glance at the data frame
tail(D,n=3)
rownames(D)
colnames(D)


dim(D)            # similar to matrices
length(D)         # = ncol(D)
as.data.frame(M)  # yet another conversion: matrix --> data.frame

```


# Accessing Data Frames
The general access to elements is as for vectors, but there are also new ways
```{r}
D
D[1:3, ]
D[6:9, -2]
D$x          # access by column name
typeof(D$x)
typeof(D$l)
D$b[3:6]
```

# Lists
List extends the data frame: different "columns" can have different length
```{r}
L=list(x=1:9,l=letters[1:3], b=1:20<10)
class(L)
str(L)  
head(L,2)
summary(L)

dim(L)
length(L)
names(L)
```

## List can be recursive
**Task**: Describe the items in the following list. What is the length of L? How many names does L have?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
L=list(x=1:9,l=list(i=1,v=c(10,20,30),m=outer(1:3,1:3)), b=1:20<10)
```

## List Access: Options and Confusions
```{r, eval=FALSE}
L$x
L[[1]]  
L[["x"]]
L[["x"]][3]
L$l$v[2]
```

**Task**: what happens with "which"?
```{r}
which(L[[1]]!=2)
which(L[[3]])
```
