# Goal 1: Show me all the data

**Scaling**: It's good practice to normalize the different variables
```{r scaling}
d=iris[,-5]   # numerical iris data (without speciee) 
ds=scale(d)   # scaled iris data (column-wise)

br=seq(-5,7,by=0.5)                                           # set common break points for the histograms below
hist(d[,"Sepal.Width"], breaks = br)                          # illustrate scaling for specific column
hist(ds[,"Sepal.Width"], breaks = br, add=TRUE, col="red")    # add histogram to current plot
legend("topright", c("orig","scaled"), fill=c("white", "red"))
```

# Heatmaps
Heatmaps are color-coded representations of numerical matrices. 

Typically the rows and columns are re-ordered according to some distance measure (default: Euclidean) 
and hierarchical clustering method (default: complete) 

There are many tools to draw heatmaps in R.
Here we use the `pheatmap` package to provide this powerful functionality

```{r pheatmap}
#install.packages("pheatmap")  # That's how we install new packages - more later
library(pheatmap)              # make packaged functions available
paste('loaded pheatmap version:', packageVersion('pheatmap'))

ds  = scale(iris[,-5])                # scaled data for heatmap
ann = data.frame(Species = iris[,5])  # meta data for annotations

# explicitly set rownames to retain association between data and metadata
rownames(ds)=rownames(iris)
rownames(ann)=rownames(iris)

pheatmap(ds, 
         annotation_row = ann,
         show_rownames = FALSE,
         )
```

There is many more parameters for more control - if you have lots of time read "?pheatmap"

# Sending plots to files
In Rstudio, we can export figures from the "Plots" tab. On the console we can define a pdf file as a new device for all subsequent figures. This is usually done only *after* the image is sufficiently optimized
```{r pdf}
pdf("heatmap.pdf")                                        # similar for jpeg, png, ...
pheatmap(ds, annotation_row = ann, show_rownames = FALSE)
dev.off()                                                 # close device = pdf file
```

# Goal 2: Show me all the data (in lower dimensions)

```{r df2mat}
M=as.matrix(iris[,-5])     # numerical data, some operations below require matrices not data frames (%*%)
s=iris[,5]                 # species attributes (factor)
```

## PCA Goals
* simplify description of data matrix $M$: data reduction & extract most important information
* maximal variance: look for direction in which data shows maximal variation
* minimal error: allow accurate reconstruction of original data 

![PCA goal](images/PCA.gif)
from amoeba @ https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues
```{r}
pca=prcomp(M, scale=TRUE)
```

*Task*: What kind of object is pca?

```{r}
S=pca$x          # score matrix = rotated and scaled data matrix

pairs(S, col=s)

pheatmap(cov(M)) # original covariance matrix

# covariance matrix of scores is diagonal (by design)
# --> principal components are uncorrelated
pheatmap(cov(S)) 
```


Notice that the higher components do not add much to the variance, so we may as well represent the transformed data in only the first two dimensions:
```{r}
plot(S[,1:2],pch=21, bg=s)  # score-plot
```


***

# Review
* use heatmaps to visualize large matrices
* scaling transformation
* installing packages: pheatmap
* exporting figures as publication-ready files
* dimensional reduction with PCA
